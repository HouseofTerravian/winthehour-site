## 🧠 What Is WTH!?

Win The Hour!™ isn't a productivity method — it's a **momentum ritual**.
Our ethos is simple: **Make Yourself Better Every Day™ (M.Y.B.E.D.)**.

The WTH! experience combines:

- ✅ Crownstrike Checkmark Rituals
- 👕 Time-Sovereignty Apparel Drops
- 📜 Mythic Dispatches (see /dispatches)
- 📱 Lock Screens + Watchfaces
- 🎯 University Poster Campaigns
- 🔒 Vaulted Proof-of-Commerce

## 🗂️ Dispatches from the Checkmark

WTH! Dispatches are sovereign brand transmissions — poetic, declarative, and timestamped.
They are not coaching articles or instructional blogs.
They exist to signal, not to teach.

➡️ Visit /dispatches to view the latest releases.

Each Dispatch is:

- 🔒 Protected by U.S. Copyright
- 🧬 Authored by Chude Muonelo
- 🛡️ Legally registered under SlateRiver LLC
- 🔭 Aligned with Vault #4 and the Lotus Engine
